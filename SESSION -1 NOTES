How a web request works
When a JavaScript client application makes an HTTP request to a Java back-end service, the following steps occur:

The JavaScript client application creates request object. This object contains information such as the method (e.g. GET, POST, PUT), the URL, and any data that needs to be sent with the request.
The JavaScript client sends the request to the server using the XMLHttpRequest or Fetch API. This is an asynchronous operation, which means the JavaScript code will continue to execute while the request is being processed.
The request is received by the back-end service, which is typically implemented using a Java web framework such as Spring. The framework extracts the information from the request, such as the method and the URL, and routes it to the appropriate code in the back-end service.
The back-end service processes the request, which can include querying a database, performing calculations, or executing other logic.
The back-end service generates a response, which is typically in the form of an HTTP response object. The response contains information such as the status code (e.g. 200 OK, 404 Not Found) and any data that needs to be sent back to the client.
The response is sent back to the JavaScript client application. The JavaScript client receives the response and can process the data or update the user interface accordingly.
It's important to note that the request and response are sent over the HTTP or HTTPS protocol, which provides a standardized way for web clients and servers to communicate. And also to note that the above is a common pattern, with many variations and alternatives using different technologies and protocols such as WebSockets, gRPC and so on.
